(2) To embed feature in the model which can explain the seasonal major changes in freight rate based on regions and locations. I have closely worked with deep learning models in combination with statistical methods to create solution for this. At the end of internship, I had created model deployed on AWS EC2 with the use of Kafka stream jobs, ElasticSearch and PostgreSQL.",
